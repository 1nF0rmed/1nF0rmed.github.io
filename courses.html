    Hey! looks like you're reading my code.
    That's cool!!
    I'm happy you took the time to understand who you are going to work with.
    This page is a review of all the courses I've taken. 
    I took these courses out of pure joy for the subjects and the want to keep myse

                                    <p>These are some of the courses that I've taken to refresh my understanding of concepts or to really quickly learn something given a small time frame. This page may not be updated on a regular basis but I try to update them every 2-3 months. </p>
                                    <p>Even though these courses were meant to be taken for 2-4 weeks, I would usually allocate a day(mostly one of the weekends) for them  and go over all the material and revise my old notes. </p>
                                    <h2>Neural Networks and Deep Learing</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        <ul class="actions">
                                            <li>Link: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning">Coursera</a></li>
                                            <li>Certificate: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/SR55G2R6KEMT">View Certificate</a></li>
                                        </ul>
                                        TL;DR: It's a good course for people who are not familiar with neural nets. Otherwise, it feels kind of repetitive (I completed the course in 1.5 days)<br><strong>Pros</strong>: Learn to implement efficient feedforward neural networks from scratch, by taking advantage of vectorized operations and caches; good understanding of how neural nets work and the reasons of their success; I loved how Dr. Andrew explained why we must initialize the weights to some small random numbers (I already knew neural nets before this course)<br>
                                        <strong>Cons</strong>: I expected to build neural nets in Tensorflow (after learning how to implement them from scratch); It'd have been good to include a gradient check (by computing the numerical gradient) to foolproof the backward pass; sometimes the explanations felt kind of repetitive (e.g. continuously going from one training example to the whole training batch). I would have just sticked to the batch learning after it was introduced

                                    <h2>Applied AI with Deep Learning</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        <ul class="actions">
                                            <li>Link: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai">Coursera</a></li>
                                            <li>Certificate: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/22PUXRSPJ4BY">View Certificate</a></li>
                                        </ul>
                                        I was pretty disppointed overall.<br> <strong>Pros</strong>: we see many types of tools and get to use some of them in the programming assignments. I feel like they wanted to give a general knowledge of the field. I particularly liked the aspects of scaling and deploying models in production.<br><strong>Cons</strong>: This honestly feels more like a rough draft than a finished and polished course. I would have liked a consolidated overview of all these tools, their pros and cons, etc. Some tools and techniques were explained in literaly 15 min(!) and in some cases simply walked through a tutorial from the tool's website (!!). A programming assignment was broken through not being updated for more recent spark versions. Some videos mentioned a non-existent programming assignment (I assume they were reused from an internal IBM training session), etc. The comparison with say Andrew Ng's course on ML is cruel.

                                    <h2>Agile with Atlassian Jira</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        <ul class="actions">
                                            <li>Link: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/agile-atlassian-jira">Coursera</a></li>
                                            <li>Certificate: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/SR55G2R6KEMT">View Certificate</a></li>
                                        </ul>
                                        I feel like this was one part Agile Scrum history/overview and two parts JIRA software walkthrough. I would have liked to see the hands on labs be more interactive instead of just a step by step guide. I also would have preferred the lions share of the content to be focused around a deep-dive on Agile rather than the software-specific material. I've been using JIRA for a few years now, so this was pretty much review for me. I still picked up a few useful tidbits here and there, however. The biggest take-aways for me: Search Keywords (AND, OR, NOT), Advanced Searching Functions (for filters) and the "Asking Why? Five Times" convention to help determine root problems in Agile.

                                    <h2>Intro to Trading with Machine Learning and GCP</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        <ul class="actions">
                                            <li>Link: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-trading-machine-learning-gcp">Coursera</a></li>

                                        </ul>
                                        This course is very introductory and sometimes sounds more like advertisement of GCP than a lecture. Moreover, probably only 40% of the content is orginal. The rest is taken from other courses (i.e. Serverless Deep Learning with TensorFlow on GCP).<br>
