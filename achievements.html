    Hey! looks like you're reading my code.
    That's cool!!
    I'm happy you took the time to understand who you are going to work with.
    
    I hope this page doesn't come across as bragging. It's just to show that 
    I can work in a high demand environment with time constraints that might seem unreasonable in a typical development environment.

                                        I was pretty disppointed overall.<br> <strong>Pros</strong>: we see many types of tools and get to use some of them in the programming assignments. I feel like they wanted to give a general knowledge of the field. I particularly liked the aspects of scaling and deploying models in production.<br><strong>Cons</strong>: This honestly feels more like a rough draft than a finished and polished course. I would have liked a consolidated overview of all these tools, their pros and cons, etc. Some tools and techniques were explained in literaly 15 min(!) and in some cases simply walked through a tutorial from the tool's website (!!). A programming assignment was broken through not being updated for more recent spark versions. Some videos mentioned a non-existent programming assignment (I assume they were reused from an internal IBM training session), etc. The comparison with say Andrew Ng's course on ML is cruel.

                                        I feel like this was one part Agile Scrum history/overview and two parts JIRA software walkthrough. I would have liked to see the hands on labs be more interactive instead of just a step by step guide. I also would have preferred the lions share of the content to be focused around a deep-dive on Agile rather than the software-specific material. I've been using JIRA for a few years now, so this was pretty much review for me. I still picked up a few useful tidbits here and there, however. The biggest take-aways for me: Search Keywords (AND, OR, NOT), Advanced Searching Functions (for filters) and the "Asking Why? Five Times" convention to help determine root problems in Agile.

                                        This course is very introductory and sometimes sounds more like advertisement of GCP than a lecture. Moreover, probably only 40% of the content is orginal. The rest is taken from other courses (i.e. Serverless Deep Learning with TensorFlow on GCP).<br>
